# **Petra Sports Academy Coaching App \- Requirements Document**

## **Overview**

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for developing a customized iPad application for Petra Sports Academy ([https://www.petrasportsaca.com/](https://www.petrasportsaca.com/)). The app will streamline operations across three training centres with 127 active players, focusing on attendance tracking, student progress monitoring across 4 core pillars (Technical, Tactical, Physical, Psychological), and fee management.

The application serves three distinct user types: Students, Coaches, and Head Coach (Kevin), with tailored interfaces and access controls. Given development by a team of five interns with limited resources, the requirements prioritize essential functionality while maintaining scalability for future expansion.
